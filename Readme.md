## [Three Days Workshop on Python Programming in Astronomy, Astrophysics & Cosmology]
### Organized by Centre for Cosmology, Astrophysics and Space Science, [CCASS](https://ghrce.raisoni.net/python-workshop/index.php](https://www.gla.ac.in/reseach-center)), GLA Mathura    
### Funded by Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics ([IUCAA](https://www.iucaa.in/en/))


I was among the invited speakers, along with [Prof S. N. Hasan](https://manuu.edu.in/University/SOS/Maths/People/778) , [Prof Priya Hasan](https://manuu.edu.in/University/SOS/Physics/People/816), and [Dr. Akshay Rana](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1510622) and in this repository, I have included all the files, including the data file and Python notebook, that were covered in two lecture+Hands-on sessions by me.

* **Lecture-Sessions**
  * Introduction to Statistics  
  * Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)  
  * Minimum Chi-square Test
  * Bayesian Statistics  


* **Hands-on Sessions**
  * Linear Model Fitting with Mock Data Using Basic Code: A Tutorial
  * Linear Model Fitting with Mock Data Using [lmfit](https://pypi.org/project/lmfit/)
